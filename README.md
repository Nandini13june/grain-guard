Wheat Disease Detection and Management Project
About the Project
This project focuses on identifying and managing three common wheat diseases: Rust, Septoria Leaf Blotch, and Powdery Mildew. These diseases can significantly impact wheat crop yield and quality, making early detection and effective management critical for sustainable agriculture.

Key Diseases Covered:
Rust (Stem, Leaf, and Stripe Rust)
Septoria Leaf Blotch
Powdery Mildew
Objective:
Develop models and tools to detect and predict wheat diseases using data from field observations, weather conditions, and crop health metrics.
Implement disease management strategies, including fungicide recommendations, resistant variety selection, and cultural practices to minimize disease impact.
Features
Rust Disease Detection: Implements algorithms to identify rust infection and estimate severity.
Septoria Leaf Blotch Analysis: Tools to detect early symptoms and suggest management practices.
Powdery Mildew Monitoring: Real-time detection of powdery mildew and recommendations for mitigation.
Technologies Used
Machine Learning: Used for image analysis and disease detection models.
Python: Core language for data processing and model training.
NumPy / Pandas: For data analysis and manipulation.
Flutter: Frontend mobile app (if applicable) for field data collection and disease alerts.
